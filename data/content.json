      "Hey, I'm Alexie Smith — a self-taught full-stack developer who enjoys turning ideas into functional, secure, and well-designed software. I started small, coding entirely on my Android phone using Termux, and over time, that hands-on learning shaped how I approach building reliable systems today.",
      "My first serious build was Secure File Server, a Node.js backend that helped me understand authentication, data flow, and modular structure. From there, I created Link Share — a complete file-sharing app with expiring links and an admin dashboard — all developed and tested through Termux and GitHub Codespaces.",
      "Later came Marketplace V1.10, my take on a product listing and order management system, followed by QuickBill Desk, a lightweight offline invoicing tool for small businesses. Each project taught me something new — from scaling backend APIs to improving frontend design and user flow.",
      "Working inside limited but creative environments like Termux and Codespaces taught me to value simplicity, efficiency, and adaptability. I love building tools that make everyday tasks easier, secure, and accessible — no matter where they run.",
      "When I'm not coding, I'm usually exploring new technologies, refining my existing projects, or improving my workflow setups. I believe every challenge is an opportunity to learn — and every small step in code adds up to something great."
